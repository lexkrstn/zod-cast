# zod-cast
ZodCast is a &lt;10kb, provider-agnostic bridge between Zod and LLMs. Stop "vibe coding" prompts and start forcing strict, type-safe JSON. It automatically translates schemas into TS interfaces, manages "retry-on-fail" loops for validation errors, and streams partial JSON for instant UI updates. 100% Type-safe. Zero bloat.
